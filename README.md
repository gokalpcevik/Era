# About Era
This is a little project that I am writing while improving my programming skills and knowledge about graphics programming.

# Compiling
This project uses vcpkg as package manager so you will have to setup CMake to use the vcpkg's toolchain and then compile. <br/>
Currently used libraries from vcpkg are:
* SDL2
* spdlog
* DirectXTK
* DirectXTex
* assimp
* EnTT
